# Educational Exercise Ideas
## [Bubble Sort Exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
  - [Another link](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheBubbleSort.html)
  - Tokens (pieces of paper, a block, or marker on the white board) will have
    an exercise name and a number associated with it
  - example: we want to make the list from lowest to highest
    - beginning list
      - 25 jumping jacks
      - 20 jump squats
      - 15 pushups
      - 10 curls
      - 5 burpees
    - 1st comparison (do 25 jumping jacks and 20 jump squats)
      - 20 jump squats
      - 25 jumping jacks
      - 15 pushups
      - 10 curls
      - 5 burpees
    - 2nd comparison (do 25 jumping jacks and 15 pushups)
      - 20 jump squats
      - 15 pushups
      - 25 jumping jacks
      - 10 curls
      - 5 burpees
   - 3rd comparison (do 25 jumping jacks and 10 curls)
      - 20 jump squats
      - 15 pushups
      - 10 curls
      - 25 jumping jacks
      - 5 burpees
  - 4th comparison (do 25 jumping jacks and 5 burpees)
      - 20 jump squats
      - 15 pushups
      - 10 curls
      - 5 burpees
      - 25 jumping jacks
  - 5th comparison (do 20 jump squats and 15 pushups)
      - 15 pushups
      - 20 jump squats
      - 10 curls
      - 5 burpees
      - 25 jumping jacks
  - etc.. etc..

## Depth versus Breadth first search Exercise
                        [1 lap]
                          / \
                         /   \
                        /     \
                [5 pushups] [10 squats]

- drawing the tree is too hard just look [here](https://medium.com/basecs/demystifying-depth-first-search-a7c14cccf056)
and replace the letters with exercises.
- we can do the exercise tree depth first and then breadth first, to do the exercises
in different orders
- or can do pre-order and post-order search of the trees

## Binary
- write the number of reps in binary (base 2) instead of base 10

## pop/push
- pop items off a list of exercises

## Shortest path [asymmetric traveling salesman problem](https://www.quantamagazine.org/one-way-salesman-finds-fast-path-home-20171005/)
- Create a random graph with edges of varying weights

## Neuroscience Exercise
unmyelinated axons: quick steps on the hop scotch trail

myelinated axon: frog jumps (nodes of ranvier)

propagation of action potential: pass the ball with legs back and forth

action potential: ropes exercise

"build up to action potential": have every exercise count as one token, wait until
the exercises have done "enough" to reach threshold and the person runs.
